I am a dedicated and passionate cybersecurity enthusiast with a recently acquired Security+ certificate, I am motivated and prepared to start my career in the cybersecurity field. Solving complex problems is something that drives me and I look forward to furthering my education and building experience in the space. Cybersecurity is not only something I look at as a career path but it's something that genuinely excites me, I truly look forward to progressing further with my skills and my network as I continue to grow and hopefully contribute to the industry. 

## Objective

My journey in computer science and tinkering around with penetration testing from a young age has led me to develop a love for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into the field. Specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst or any entry level IT / Cybersecurity Job.
